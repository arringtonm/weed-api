relatively "easy":

-- fix description/linking appearance
    make it appear below or somewhere else instead of new window (toggle, for instance)


-- add links/clickability to strain names
    copy/paste/modify text from other sections



medium:

-- redo layout to be pretty/portfolio ready
    conceptualize layout
    build pieces with clickthrough divs or whatever

-- api calls in back end
    build method


harder:

-- switch functionality of effects to checkbox (compare multiple calls against each other with arrays/loops)
    change html and associated code to checkboxes from radio
    make api call and array for each checked box
    compare contents of each array and return common items
